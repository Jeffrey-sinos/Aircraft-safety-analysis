# Aircraft Safety Analysis

## Overview
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The goal of this project is to determine the aircraft with the least risk of accident for a company seeking to diversify its portfolio by venturing out into the aviation industry specifically operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises. 
I can put forward recommendations to the company based on the analysis to help the company become a key player in the aviation industry.

## Business Understanding
My company is expanding to new industries to diversify its portfolio, specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises.
However, there is a lack of knowledge about the potential risks of dealing with aircrafts.
I am tasked with determining the lowest risk aircraft for the company to venture into the aviation industry.
Some of the key questions asked during the analysis were:
- How many injuries were suffered for different manufacturers?
- Is there a relationship between the number of fatalities and the number of engines in
an aircraft?
- What is the general trend for the number of fatalities from year to year?

## Data Understanding and Analysis
The data used in this project was collected by the National Transportation and Safety Board between 1962 and 2003 on aviation accidents that occurred in the United States and in international waters. The original dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses. The analysis involved cleaning of the data to remove irrelevant columns and handle missing values. Some of the key variables used to examine aircraft safety were:
- Make
- Model
- Number of Engines
- Total Fatal injuries

This visualization shows the number of fatalities suffered per year:

For further exploration of this analysis I created an interactive dashboard that can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/views/Aircraft-safety-analysis/Airplaneincidentsanalysis?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link&:device=desktop

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis done and the visualizations created, these were the three recommendations I would give the company:

- The company should consider purchasing aircrafts built from 2015 onwards to ensure compliance with the latest technology and safety procedures.
- The company should consider selecting aircrafts manufactured by Airbus and Embraer. They are both well known manufacturers and did not suffer as many fatal injuries in accidents compared to the other manufacturers.
- The company should consider selecting aircrafts with 2 engines or 4 engines. Twin engine airplanes are the most popular currently and did not suffer as many accidents as single engine airplanes.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the comprehensive analysis done has provided useful insights for my company as we venture into the aviation industry. It is important that these recommendations be included together with other factors before making the decision to venture into the aviation industry.
